# Polymesh Portal

The Polymesh Portal is a user-friendly interface for interacting with a Polymesh Blockchain account. It's built with the [Polymesh SDK](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/polymesh-sdk) and utilizes the [Polymesh Browser Extension Signing Manager](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/signing-managers/tree/main/packages/browser-extension-signing-manager) and [Polymesh SubQuery GraphQL API](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/polymesh-subquery). This portal serves as a reference implementation for developers building on Polymesh.
